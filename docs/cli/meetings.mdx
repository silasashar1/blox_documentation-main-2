# Meetings

The CLI allows you to perform some basic functions with meetings, including
creating a meeting and viewing its sessions.

More functionality will make its way here soon.

## Creating a meeting

Creating a meeting is as simple as running:

```shell
dyte meetings create
```

meeting_

## Viewing a meeting's sessions

You can view a meeting's sessions by running:

```shell
dyte meetings info
```
