A catalog is a collection of datasets and attributes. Content Hub enables you to create and manage different types of catalogs by ingesting data from various data sources, processing these and making them available for applications

### Explore

The Catalog Explore section provides a comprehensive overview of your catalog and allows you to manage its content. This includes managing upload, sync, and mapped field settings, accessing content that failed to sync, viewing individual data points and editing metadata or predicted tags, and accessing enriched tags for each content individually.

Additionally, you can view the taxonomy linked to the catalog and provide feedback. In this document, we'll explore the various features of the Catalog Explore section, including how to access it and navigate its different components.


### Enrich

Enrich offers a simple and intuitive workflow for organizing data. You can create a Project for different segments using any Catalog, and use Enrich to manage taxonomy and visualize data in an intuitive way. With Enrich, you can label raw data and build machine learning models at a multi-X speedup, enabling you to automate the tagging of data at scale. These models can be used to power content search, personalization, and recommendations.
