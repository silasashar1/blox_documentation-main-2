# Introduction

The meeting chat object is stored in `dyteClient.chat`, which has methods for
sending and receiving messages. There are 3 types of messages that can be sent
in chat - `text`, `images`, and `files`.

The `dyteClient.chat.messages` array contains all the messages that have been
sent in the chat. This is an array of objects, where each object is of type
`DyteChatMessage`.

The `DyteChatMessage` class has the following properties:

- `userId` : UserID of the sender.
- `displayName` : Display name of the sender.
- `read` : Boolean whether the message is read or not.
- `pluginId` : Plugin ID of the message.
- `time` : Time at which the message was sent. It returns a `String` in milliseconds since epoch format.
- `type` : `DyteMessageType` for type of message being sent (whether
  `DyteMessageType.text`, `DyteMessageType.image` or `DyteMessageType.file`).

There are 3 message classes that extends `DyteChatMessage`, and each has some
extra property in addition to `DyteChatMessage` properties:

- `DyteTextMessage`
- `DyteImageMessage`
- `DyteFileMessage`

#### DyteTextMessage:

- `message`: Text message sent.

#### DyteImageMessage:

- `link`: URL of the image sent.

#### DyteFileMessage:

- `name`: Name of the file to be sent.
- `link`: URL of the file sent.
- `size`: Size of the file in bytes.
