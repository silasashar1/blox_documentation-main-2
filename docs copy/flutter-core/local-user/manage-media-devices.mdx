# Manage Media Devices

Media devices represents the hardware for the camera, microphone and speaker
devices. To get the list of media devices that are currently being used, you can
use the following methods:

### For audio devices:

To get audio devices, use `getAudioDevices()` method on `localUser` object. It
returns `List<DyteAudioDevice>` object, where each object in the list refers to
an audio device of the system.

```dart
// Get all audio devices
final audioDevices = await dyteClient.localUser.getAudioDevices();
```

### For video devices

To get audio devices, use `getVideoDevices()` method on `localUser` object. It
returns `List<DyteVideoDevice>` object, where each object in the list refers to
an video device of the system.

```dart
// Get all video devices
final videoDevices = await dyteClient.localUser.getVideoDevices();
```

## Set Audio Device

To set an active audio device, you can call `setAudioDevice()` method. This
takes a `DyteAudioDevice` object that needs to be set active for audio.

```dart
await dyteClient.localUser.setAudioDevice(device);
```

## Set Video Device

To set a active video device, you can call `setVideoDevice()` method. This takes
a `DyteVideoDevice` object that needs to be set active for video.

```dart
await dyteClient.localUser.setVideoDevice(device);
```
