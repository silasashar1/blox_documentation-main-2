# Introduction

The meetings polls object can be accessed using `meeting.polls`. It provides
methods to create polls, vote, and more.

`meeting.polls.polls` returns an array of all polls created in a meeting, where
each element is an object of type `DytePollMessage`.

The type `DytePollMessage` is the main class for any poll in Dyte. It also
contains list of `DytePollOption` which are options for a given poll. And every
`DytePollOption` has list of votes inside of it. Votes are objects of class
`DytePollVote` which internally has id and name of the vote.

One can easily create, vote and view polls by listening to callbacks on
`meeting` object.

## Listening to new polls in a meeting

To receive new poll messages, you must implement the `onPollUpdates()` method from
the callback DytePollEventsListener. You can subscribe to this event by
using the `meeting.addMeetingEventsListener(dytePollEventsListener)` method.

```swift
    extension MeetingViewModel: DytePollEventsListener {
      func onNewPoll(poll: DytePollMessage) {
        // code to handle new poll
      }

      func onPollUpdates(pollMessages: [DytePollMessage]) {
        // code to handle polls and their vote updates
      }
    }
```
