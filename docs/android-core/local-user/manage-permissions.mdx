# Media Permissions

To get media permissions (audio/video) for localUser we can do as follows

```kotlin
val isCameraPermissionGranted
  = meeting.localUser.isCameraPermissionGranted
val isMicrophonePermissionGranted
  = meeting.localUser.isMicrophonePermissionGranted
```

Similarly to listen to callbacks regarding media permissions once user joins
the meeting

```kotlin
meeting.addSelfEventsListener(object : DyteSelfEventsListener {
    override fun onMeetingRoomJoinedWithoutCameraPermission() {
      // when meeting room is joined without camera permission
    }

    override fun onMeetingRoomJoinedWithoutMicPermission() {
      // when meeting room is joined without microphone permission
    }
});
```
