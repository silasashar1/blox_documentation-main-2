To begin, from the Vue Home Page, hover over Data Hub’s Document Manager and click on "Documents" on the navigation bar to reach the Documents Listing.

### Annotate and Review Extractions

Review extractions and provide feedback on your uploaded documents through our Document Annotate screen. This feature offers a simple and intuitive way to validate information extracted from documents with a side-by-side UX.

To access any document’s annotate screen, click on the document name or the ‘annotate’ action in the document listing. Note that the annotation screen is accessible only after the document has been processed.

#### Document Preview

On the document annotation screen, you'll see a side-by-side view of the document preview and its extracted values. 

- To view or change the Document Type classification, use the drop-down at the top of the page extraction panel. Changing the Document Type reprocesses the document to derive relevant data based on your selection.
- Each attribute's annotation box on the document preview corresponds to an extracted value card on the page extraction panel and vice versa.

- Each card on the panel contains an attribute name, the extracted value, and a confidence score. Available actions include:
    - **Edit Extracted Value**: Edit the value directly within the input field.
    - **Edit Annotation**: Click the ‘Edit’ icon to view attribute details or edit the annotation box on the preview.
    - **Clear**: Clears the extracted value.
    - **Show/Hide Formatted Values**: Toggle to show or hide the formatted values when an attribute has a defined output format.
- For table annotations, click `View` to see the extractions in two views:
    
    - **Overlay**: Overlays the table on the canvas with the extracted values.
    - **Data Table**: Displays extracted values in a separate, spreadsheet-like table for detailed viewing and editing.

#### Feedback & Learning

As you edit predictions and/or annotation crops, your feedback is saved and used for training to increase the accuracy of subsequent predictions. This training is triggered automatically once a critical mass of feedback data is collected.
