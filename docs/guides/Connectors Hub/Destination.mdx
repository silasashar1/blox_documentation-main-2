### Destination Listing
View the list of “All Destinations” created in a table format. This is where the created destinations are listed for users to access and view easily. From here, you can either create a new Destination or manage an existing Destination, update its configuration, view the details of the destination, and create the destination.

### Destination Search
You can search for the created Destination using the Destination name via the search bar or use one of the suggested/recently searched keywords. You can find the search results populated in the table.

### Delete Destination
From the Destination listing table, next to each Destination name, click on the Delete icon under actions. Clicking Delete will prompt the user with an overlay modal that asks if you want to delete the destination for sure. Upon clicking on “Delete,” the destination will be deleted from the listing. Deleting the destination will unlink it from all the linked features and permanently delete it, and the content from our system.


### Edit Destination
From the destination listing table, next to each destination name, click on the edit icon under actions. Clicking on edit will take you to the destination details page where you can edit the configurations of the destination. This will make edits to the destination and save it on the system.

The above image is the reference for the destination listing page.

### Destination Creation
On the destination listing page, there will be a button called “Create destination.” Clicking upon it will redirect you to the creation page where you can add the details of the configuration. The first step is to give:
- Destination name (Mandatory field, supports alphanumerics, space, and hyphen).
- Select destination type (Mandatory field, the data is being imported to this type).

Another dialog will open where you can select the “Select destination type.” In this dialog, there will be a list of destinations to select from. There is also a search bar which can be used to search for a specific data source. Upon choosing the destination type, you have to define the destination next.

Depending on the type of destination selected, the details for the destination definition will change. Once the above mandatory fields are filled, there will be an option called “Test connection to destination” clicking on which will prompt if the connection was successful or not.

NOTE: Test connection helps verify the credentials & other details provided during source configuration is valid, by establishing a link to the source. Test connection must be successful in order to finish creating a source.
