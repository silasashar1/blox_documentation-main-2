## Change default audio / video settings

By default as soon as you join the meeting the SDK will produce your video and
audio streams. To change this behaviour use the `default` parameter

```ts {5}
const meeting = await DyteClient.init({
  authToken,
  defaults: {
    audio: false, // Disable user's audio by default
    video: true, // Enable user's video by default
  },
});
```

## Setup tracks

If audio and video tracks are disabled during the `DyteClient` initialization
process. You can setup the audio and video tracks by simply calling setup tracks
method like below:

```ts
meeting.self.setupTracks({ audio: true, video: true });
```

## Change the name of the local user

Change the user's name by calling `setName` method. The changed name will
reflect across all participants ONLY if the change happens before joining the
meeting.

```ts
await meeting.self.setName('New Name');
```

## Mute/Unmute microphone

```ts
// Mute Audio
await meeting.self.disableAudio();

// Unmute Audio
await meeting.self.enableAudio();

// Get current status
meeting.self.audioEnabled;
```

## Enable/Disable camera

```ts
// Disable Video
await meeting.self.disableVideo();

// Enable Video
await meeting.self.enableVideo();

// Get current status
meeting.self.videoEnabled;
```

## Enable / Disable Screen share

```ts
// Enable Screenshare
await meeting.self.enableScreenShare();

// Disable Screenshare
await meeting.self.disableScreenShare();

// Get current status
meeting.self.screenShareEnabled;
```

### Screen share configuration

You can set the defaults for screen share during initialization

```ts
const meeting = await DyteClient.init({
  authToken,
  defaults: {
    screenShare: {
      displaySurface: 'window',
    },
  },
});
```
