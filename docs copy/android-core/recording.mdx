# Recording

The `meeting.recording` object can be used start and stop recordings in a meeting. You can also get the current status of a recording using this API.

The `meeting.recording` object has the following properties:

- `recordingState`: Indicates the current recording state of the meeting.

## Start a recording

To start a recording, you can call the `start` method in the `meeting.recording`
object. The valid states are `IDLE`, `STARTING`, `RECORDING`, and `STOPPING`.

```kotlin
meeting.recording.start();
```

## Stop a recording

Call `meeting.recording.stop()` to stop the active recording.

```kotlin
meeting.recording.stop();
```

## Pause a recording

Call `meeting.recording.pause()` to pause the active recording.

```kotlin
meeting.recording.pause();
```

## Resume a paused recording

Call `meeting.recording.resume()` to resume the paused recording.

```kotlin
meeting.recording.resume();
```

## Get active recording state

The `meeting.recording.recordingState` property describes the current state of
the recording. The valid states are `IDLE`, `STARTING`, `RECORDING`, and
`STOPPING`.

## Listen to recording state changes

The changes to `meeting.recording.recordingState` can be listened by implementing `onMeetingRecordingStateUpdated` from `DyteRecordingEventsListener`. You can attach this observer by calling `meeting.addRecordingEventsListener(listener)`.

```kotlin
meeting.addRecordingEventsListener(object : DyteRecordingEventsListener {
    override fun onMeetingRecordingStarted() {
      // on recording started
    }

    override fun onMeetingRecordingEnded() {
      // on recording ended
    }

    override fun onMeetingRecordingStateUpdated(state: DyteRecordingState) {
      // on recording state update
    }

    override fun onMeetingRecordingStopError(e: Exception) {
      // when local user tried to end recording but it fails
    }

    override fun onMeetingRecordingPauseError(e: Exception) {
      // error in pausing the active recording
    }

    override fun onMeetingRecordingResumeError(e: Exception) {
      // error in resuming a paused recording
    }
  })
```
