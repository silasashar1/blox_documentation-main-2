Content Hub enables you to create and manage different types of catalogs by ingesting data from various data sources, processing these, and making them available for applications.

## Getting to Content Hub



`Navigation`

* From the Vue Home Page &rarr; Click on Content Hub to visit the Content Home Screen. 
* Click on Explore on the navigation bar.
* Alternatively, hover over the Content Hub on the navigation bar and click on Explore.


## Create a new Catalog 

A catalog is a collection of datasets and attributes.

In the Explore screen, click on “Create new” to create a blank Catalog (no configuration is preselected), or Click on one of the “Suggested” Catalog to create a Catalog with some configuration preselected.
1. Enter an unique Catalog Name
2. Select a Catalog Type.
3. Select a Segment for the Catalog.

:::note
* It is mandatory to select a catalog type & segment during Catalog creation process
* You can save your Catalog configuration anytime by clicking on “Continue Later” CTA & clicking on “Save & Exit”. 
* The Catalog is displayed on the listing screen in a draft state. (Partially filled details are not saved).
:::


## Configure a Connector
 
Connector enables you to connect with a data source that is used to fetch data. There are multiple upload methods supported in Vue. Below are some of the supported connectors and how to use them.


* Enter the Upload Method Name for the connector
* Choose an Upload method type from the dropdown
:::note
Depending on the upload method selected, the corresponding configuration fields will be displayed.

* Fill all the mandatory fields for the selected upload method type
* Click on “Test Connection”.
:::note
Test Connection verifies all the details provided are valid. Test connection must be successful in order to proceed to the next step.

There are 4 pre-set  catalog types currently supported in Vue:

* Product Catalog 
* Banner Catalog 
* Offer Catalog 
* Documents 
Catalog type enables Vue to identify the type of incoming data, so that it can be processed accordingly. In addition to these, any other type of catalogs can be uploaded as well which will be processed as is, with no presets.

And there are  segments types currently supported in Vue:

1. Default/No Segment 
2. Fashion 
3. Grocery 
4. Furniture 
5. Electronics 
6. Beauty 
7. Book 
8. Home & Kitchen 
9. Other 
10. Appliances

Choosing segment type configures the attributes to be mapped in the next step. It also enables Vue to automatically extract attributes according to the segment type.
:::

:::note
The default extraction of attributes is only supported if the catalog type is product catalog and the segment type is fashion.
:::
## Set up sync settings 

Sync frequency is the interval with which the catalog is to be fetched from the given data source. You can choose to either append or replace the existing catalog with the incoming catalog.

1. Once ‘Test Connection’ is successful, optionally you can also configure the Sync Settings.
2. Select a ‘Sync Mode’
3. From the dropdown select a ‘Sync Frequency’

:::note
Depending on the ‘Sync Frequency’ selected, the corresponding configuration fields will be displayed.

* Configure all the required fields, to finish setting up Sync for the Catalog
* After you finish configuring the connector, Click on “Next Step” to proceed to the Map Fields step.
