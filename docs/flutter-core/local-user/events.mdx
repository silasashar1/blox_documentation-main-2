# Local User - Events

You can subscribe to various local user events:

- To subscribe, pass the instance of `LocalUserListener` class created below
  to `addSelfEventsListener()` method of `dyteClient` instance as follows:

```dart {2}
dyteClient.addSelfEventsListener(LocalUserListener());
```

- Implement `DyteSelfEventsListener` to a class say `LocalUserListener`, and
  listen to event from `DyteSelfEventsListener` by overriding them. This class
  can be user to manage your state in the application.

```dart
class LocalUserListener implements DyteSelfEventsListener {

  ...

  @override
  void onAudioDevicesUpdated() {
    /// code to handle onAudioDevicesUpdated() event
  }

  ...
}
```

### Video update

Triggered when the user starts / stops the video using `enableVideo()`/
`disableVideo()`, or host turns-off the video.

```dart
class LocalUserListener implements DyteSelfEventsListener {

  ...

  @override
  void onVideoUpdate(bool videoEnabled) {
    if(isVideoEnabled){
      // Video is enabled, other users can see the video.
    } else {
      // Video is disabled, others users can't see the video.
    }

  //  or alternatively you can pass the bool through state as demonstrated in example app.
  }

  ...
}
```

### Audio update

Triggered when the user starts / stops the audio using `enableAudio()`/
`disableAudio()`, or host mutes the audio.

```dart

class LocalUserListener implements DyteSelfEventsListener {

  ...

  @override
  void onAudioUpdate(bool audioEnabled) {
    if (audioEnabled) {
        // audio is enabled, and other participants in room can hear local user
      } else {
        // audio is disabled, and other participants in room can not hear local user.
      }

    //  or alternatively you can pass the bool through state as demonstrated in example app.
  }
  ...
}
```

### Proximity changed

Triggered by any change in proximity, such as when the device is brought near or moved away from an earpiece, which triggers the display to turn on or off.

```dart

class LocalUserListener implements DyteSelfEventsListener {

  ...

  @override
  void onProximityChanged(bool isNear) {
    if (isNear) {
        // Display should be turned off, as user might be speaking through ear piece
      } else {
        // Display should be tunred on, as user might be looking at display and listening through speaker/earphones.
      }
  }
  ...
}
```

### Waitlist status

When the waiting room feature is enabled for a meeting, you can use the `onWaitListStatusUpdate()` callback function to receive updates on waiting room status changes.

```dart

class LocalUserNotifier implements DyteSelfEventsListener {

  ...

  @override
  void onWaitListStatusUpdate(DyteWaitListStatus waitListStatus) {
    // DyteWaitListStatus is an enum with the following values:
    // if `DyteWaitListStatus.none`, user is not on the waitlist
    // if `DyteWaitListStatus.waiting`, user is on the waitlist
    // if `DyteWaitListStatus.accepted`, user has been accepted in the meeting.
    // if `DyteWaitListStatus.rejected`, user has been rejected from the meeting.
  }

  ...
}
```

## Local user removed

When the local user is removed from the meeting, the `onRemovedFromMeeting()` callback is triggered.

```dart

@override
void onRemovedFromMeeting() {
  // Display an alert to the user indicating that they are no longer in the meeting.
}
```

## Change in audio/video source

Whenever user changes audio/video source using `setAudioDevice(DyteAudioDevice)` and `setVideoDevice(DyteVideoDevice)` respectively [ref: [here](/flutter-core/local-user/manage-media-devices)], `onAudioDevicesUpdated()` and `onVideoDevicesChanged()` are triggered respectively.

```dart
@override
void onAudioDevicesUpdated() {
  // triggered on successful execution of `setAudioDevice(DyteAudioDevice)`
}

@override
void onVideoDeviceChanged(DyteVideoDevice videoDevice) {
  // triggered on successful execution of `setVideoDevice(DyteVideoDevice)`
}

```

## Process message within the room

Manage messages within the room using `onRoomMessage(String message)` callback.

```dart
@override
void onRoomMessage(String type, Map<String, dynamic> payload) {
  // triggered when a message is sent within the room.
}
```
