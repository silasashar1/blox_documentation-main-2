# Flutter Core SDK Quickstart

This quickstart shows how to use Dyte's Flutter Core SDK to add live video and
audio call to your Flutter applications.

For getting started quickly, you can use our sample code. You can clone and run
a sample application from the
[Flutter Core SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/dyte-io/flutter-samples/tree/main/flutter_core).

## Objective

You'll learn how to:

- Install the Dyte SDK
- Initialize the SDK
- Configure a Dyte meeting
- Initialize the Dyte meeting
- And go live with your Dyte meeting

## Before Getting Started

- Make sure you've read the
  [Getting Started with Dyte](/getting-started) topic and
  completed the steps in the
  [Integrate Dyte](/getting-started#integrate-dyte) section.
  You must complete the following steps:
  - Create a [Dyte Developer Account](https://dev.dyte.io/)
  - Create a
    [Dyte Meeting](/api/?v=v2#/operations/create_meeting)
  - [Add Participant](/api/?v=v2#/operations/add_participant)
    to the meeting
- Install Flutter on your system
- (For iOS apps) Install
  [Xcode](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwin55bqodH8AhUVQXwKHaR-DAsQFnoECA0QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fxcode%2Fid497799835%3Fmt%3D12&usg=AOvVaw2fEvMbfRtGhB4SPHYB54NX)
- Ensure that Rosetta is installed with Xcode on Mac computers with Apple
  silicon.
- Make sure your Mac computers are running macOS version 12.0 Monterey or
  higher.
- (For Android apps) Install
  [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), or install the Android
  SDK for Command-Line Interface (CLI) only.

## Step 1: Install the SDK

1. To install the SDK, add the Dyte Core Flutter SDK dependency into the
   `pubspec.yaml` file.

   ```dart
   flutter pub add dyte_core
   ```

2. Then import the following package into your project:

   ```dart
   import 'package:dyte_core/dyte_core.dart';
   ```

After importing the package, perform the following steps for Android and iOS.


### For iOS

1. Set your platform to iOS 13.0 or above in your Podfile.

```dart
platform :ios, '13.0'
```

2. Add the following entries to the `Info.plist` file. This gives permission to
   your app to access the camera and microphone, access photos, install the
   required fonts and icons.

```dart
<key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
<string>We will use your Bluetooth to access your Bluetooth headphones.</string>

<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We will use your Bluetooth to access your Bluetooth headphones.</string>

<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>For people to see you during meetings, we need access to your camera.</string>

<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>For people to hear you during meetings, we need access to your microphone.</string>

<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>For people to share, we need access to your photos.</string>
```

In iOS, if you are allowing user to download attachments in chat, add the following permissions in your app's Info.plist:

```
<key>LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace</key>
<true/>
<key>UIFileSharingEnabled</key>
<true/>
```

:::tip Note

If you intend to publish your app to the Google Play or App Store, you'll need
to perform a few additional steps. So if you're working on release builds and
not debug builds, refer to the [Release Builds](#release-builds) section.

:::

## Step 2: Initialize the SDK

The `DyteMobileClient` is the main class of the SDK. It is the entry point and
the only class required to initialize Dyte SDK.

```dart
final dyteClient = DyteMobileClient();
```

## Step 3: Set the meeting properties

Set the properties in the `DyteMeetingInfo` class. You just need to provide the
participant's `authToken`.

| Name        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `authToken` | After you've created the meeting, <br/> add each participant to the meeting <br/> using the [Add Participant API](/api?v=v2#/operations/add_participant)<br/> (The presetName created earlier <br/> must be passed in the body <br/> of the Add Participant API request) <br/> The API response contains the `authToken`. |
| `baseUrl`   | The base URL of the Dyte server. Default value is `https://api.dyte.io/v2`. This is an optional argument.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `enableAudio` | A boolean value to enable or disable audio in the meeting. Default value is `true`. This is an optional argument.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `enableVideo` | A boolean value to enable or disable video in the meeting. Default value is `true`. This is an optional argument.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

```dart
final meetingInfo = DyteMeetingInfoV2(
                    authToken: '<authToken>',
                    baseUrl: 'https://api.dyte.io/v2',                    // optional argument, if you want to pass your own baseUrl
                    enableAudio: false,             // optional argument, to enable or disable audio in the meeting
                    enableVideo: false,             // optional argument, to enable or disable video in the meeting
                  );
```

## Step 4: Initialize the connection request

To initialize the connection request, call the `init()` method obtained on
`dyteClient` with the `meetingInfo` argument. This will establish the connection
with the Dyte meeting server.

```dart
dyteClient.init(meetingInfo);
```

By registering state observers, you receive callbacks for this action on the
meeting object.

```dart

class RoomStateNotifier implements DyteMeetingRoomEventsListener {

  ...

  @override
  void onMeetingInitStarted() {
    /// on meeting init started
  }

  override
  void onMeetingInitCompleted() {
    /// on meeting init completed
  }

  @override
  void onMeetingInitFailed(Exception exception) {
    /// on meeting init failed
  }

  ...
}

```

Subscibe to the `DyteMeetingRoomEventsListener` to receive the callbacks for the meeting object.

```dart
dyteClient.addMeetingRoomEventsListener(RoomStateNotifier());
```

## Step 5: Connect to the meeting

Now, if you have established the connection with the Dyte meeting server
successfully i.e. if you received `onMeetingInitCompleted` callback, next step is to join the room.

### Join the room

To join the meeting room, call `joinRoom()` method on the `dyteClient` instance
as shown below.

```dart
dyteClient.joinRoom();
```

By registering state observers, you receive callbacks for join related actions on the
meeting object.

```dart
class RoomStateNotifier implements DyteMeetingRoomEventsListener {

  ...

  @override
  void onMeetingRoomJoinStarted() {
    /// Handle join start state
  }

  @override
  void onMeetingRoomJoined() {
    /// Handle joining completion, ex: move to room screen
  }

  @override
  void onMeetingRoomJoinFailed(exception){
    /// Handle failure
  }

  ...
}
```

Successful joining of meeting is indicated by `onMeetingRoomJoined` callback.

### Leave the room

Once the meeting is over, you can leave the meeting room.

To leave the meeting room, call `leaveRoom()` method on the `dyteClient` as
shown below.

```dart
dyteClient.leaveRoom();
```

By registering state observers, you receive callbacks for this action on the
meeting object.

```dart
class RoomStateNotifier implements DyteMeetingRoomEventsListener {

  ...

  @override
  void onMeetingRoomLeaveStarted() {
    /// on meeting room leave started
  }

  @override
  void onMeetingRoomLeaveCompleted() {
    /// on meeting room left
  }

  ...

}
```

Successfully exiting the meeting is indicated by `onMeetingRoomLeaveCompleted` callback.

## Release Builds

If you intend to publish your app to the Google Play or App Store, perform the
following steps after installing the SDKs. So if you're working on release
builds and not debug builds, do the following:

### For iOS release builds

Disable `BITCODE` in your Podfile.

```dart
post_install do |installer|
   installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
       target.build_configurations.each do |config|
           config.build_settings['ENABLE_BITCODE'] = 'NO'
       end
   end
end
```
