### Version specific deployments

Dyte lets you publish multiple versions of your plugins. You can choose to
deploy a specific version.

List all available versions of your plugin

```shell
dyte plugins version list
```

You can now select the version you wish to deploy.

```shell
dyte plugins version change-latest -v <version>
```

### Unpublishing

Unpublishing a plugin removes all versions of it from our database and your
meetings.

```shell
dyte plugins unpublish
```

If you wish to delete a specific version of the plugin you can do that with

```shell
dyte plugins version delete -v <version>
```

### Plugin configuration

You can update your `dyte-config` to update properties like name, description,
build path and more. These changes will reflect once you publish or deploy the
plugin.

### Access control and visibility

Each Dyte user is associated to a preset. This preset dictates the meeting
experience for that user. You can customize how this preset can interact with a
plugin using the [Preset Editor](https://dev.dyte.io/roles-presets).

In your preset editor you can select the plugins you want a preset to have
access to.

**Manage Plugin Interactions**

We let you manage how your users interacts with a plugin. This setting can be
configured differently for each plugin.

| ** Control ** | ** Description **                                              |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| View Only     | The user can only view the plugin.                             |
| Full Access   | The user can interact with the plugin and has control over it. |

**Manage Access Control.**

You can specify who has access to launch/close plugins.

| ** Control ** | ** Description **                                                     |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Launch        | Preset can launch plugins                                             |
| Close         | Preset can close plugins                                              |
| Control       | Preset can give others the access to launch/close plugins temporarily |
