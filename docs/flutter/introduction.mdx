# Introduction

Dyte's Flutter UI Kit is a prebuilt design library of UI components that makes it easy to integrate video and voice calls into any Flutter app within minutes.

## Usage

The UI Kit under the hood works on top of the same Core SDK that is publicly available. Core SDK handles all the low-level media and network handling parts
of a meeting and exposes methods and properties that the UI Kit uses

Uses a layered design structure, allowing you to start with one prebuilt component and slowly go down layers and add custom UI incrementally as your needs evolve.

- **Use prebuilt component**: You can use prebuilt component to
  create your meeting quickly. With this component, you don't have to handle all
  the states, dialogs, and other aspects of managing the application. The UI kit
  also respect your permissions and theming configuration from the preset.

  For more information, see [UI Kit Quickstart](/flutter/quickstart).

- **Mix and match**: Use some components from our component library, build some custom components yourself.

## Supported Versions

Here are the version requirements:

- Android SDK version: 23+
- iOS deployment version: 13.0+

```

```
