# Introduction - Room participants

The data regarding all meeting participants is stored under
`meeting.participants`. Use the methods and events to consume the participants
data.

## Room participants object.

- `joined`: A list that contains all the participants who have joined the
  meeting.
- `waitlisted`: A list that contains all the participants waiting to join the
  meeting.
- `active`: A list that contains all the participants except the local user who
  are supposed to be on the screen at the moment
- `pinned`: A nullable participant object. If any participant is pinned is that
  participant else it is null.
- `screenshares`: A list that contains all the participants who have shared
  screen in the meeting.
- `gridInfo`: This object has all data related to pages in the room.

Each participant in each of the `joined`, `waitlisted`, `active` and
`screenshares` list is of type `DyteMeetingParticipant`.

For example, to get all the participants who joined the meeting:

```swift
// get all joined participants
let joinedParticipants = meeting.participants.joined;
```

For example, to get all the active participants in the meeting:

```swift
// get all active participants
let joinedParticipants = meeting.participants.active;
```

Therefore, if you were to make a grid of participants, you'd use the `active`
list, but to display all participants in the meeting you'd use the `joined`
list.

## Grid info for the room

Following object can be retrieved from `meeting` object by using
`meeting.participants.gridInfo`. This object will have necessary information
regarding pageCount, next page, previos page, current page, etc.

```swift
  let pageCount: Int
  let currentPageNumber: Int
  let isNextPagePossible: Bool
  let isPreviousPagePossible: Bool
  let shouldShowPaginator: Bool
  let maxVideoCountPerPage: Int
```

## Video update for all participants

Triggered when the user starts / stops the video using `enableVideo` or
`disableVideo`

```swift
extension MeetingViewModel: DyteParticipantEventsListener {
     func videoUpdate(videoEnabled: Boolean, participant: DyteMeetingParticipant) {
      if (videoEnabled) {
        // video is enabled, and other participants in room can see local user
      } else {
        // video is disabled, and other participants in room can not see local user.
      }
    }
}
```

## Audio update for all participants

Triggered when the user starts / stops the audio using `enableAudio` or
`disableAudio`

```swift
extension MeetingViewModel: DyteParticipantEventsListener {
    func audioUpdate(audioEnabled: Boolean, participant: DyteMeetingParticipant) {
      if (audioEnabled) {
        // audio is enabled, and other participants in room can hear local user
      } else {
        // audio is disabled, and other participants in room can not hear local user.
      }
    }
}
```

## Move between pages in paginated mode

The `setPage(pageNumber: Int)` method allows you to switch between pages of
participants present in the meeting.

```swift
// switch to 1st page
meeting.participants.setPage(1)
```

## Host control methods

The `meeting.participants` object has host control methods that allow you to
disable the audio and video streams of other users in the meeting (given that
the user preset has the right permissions).

```swift
// mute all participants
meeting.participants.disableAllAudio()

// mute a single participant
let participantToUpdate = meeting.participants.joined.first
participantToUpdate.disableAudio()

// disable video for all participants
meeting.participants.disableAllVideo()

// disable video for a single participant
let participantToUpdate = meeting.participants.joined.first()
participantToUpdate.disableVideo()
```

To remove all participants from a meeting, you can call the `kickAll()` method.

```swift
// remove all participants from the meeting
meeting.participants.kickAll()

// remove a single participant
let participantToRemove = meeting.participants.joined.first()
participantToRemove.kick()
```
