1. **Initiate Upload**
   - Navigate to the Document Listing Screen.
   - Click the **‘+ Upload Documents’** button to begin the upload process.
   - Provide a name for your Document Batch to help organize and identify it later.

2. **Select Document Type**
   - Choose the specific Document Type for the documents you are uploading. This helps in categorizing and applying specific workflows to your documents.
   - Alternatively, select **Auto-Classify** to utilize Vue's AI capabilities. Our systems will predict and match each document to a registered document type automatically.

3. **Tagging**
   - You can add tags to your batch of documents. Tags are incredibly helpful for organizing and later finding documents through search. Think of tags as keywords or labels that make retrieval easier.

4. **Upload Your Documents**
   - Upload your documents by either:
     - Dragging and dropping one or more documents into the dropbox area.
     - Clicking the **‘Browse’** button to select documents from your device.
   - Once you have selected all the documents you wish to upload, click the **‘Upload’** button to finalize the process.
