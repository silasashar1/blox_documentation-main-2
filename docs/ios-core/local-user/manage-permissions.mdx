# Media Permissions

To get media permissions (audio/video) for localUser we can do as follows

```swift
let isCameraPermissionGranted
  = meeting.localUser.isCameraPermissionGranted
let isMicrophonePermissionGranted
  = meeting.localUser.isMicrophonePermissionGranted
```

Similarly to listen to callbacks regarding media permissions once user joins the
meeting

```swift
extension MeetingViewModel: DyteSelfEventsListener {
    func onMeetingRoomJoinedWithoutCameraPermission() {
      // when meeting room is joined without camera permission
    }

    func onMeetingRoomJoinedWithoutMicPermission() {
      // when meeting room is joined without microphone permission
    }
}
```
