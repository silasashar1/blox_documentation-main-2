# Introduction - Room participants

The data regarding all meeting participants is stored under `meeting.participants`. Use the methods and events to consume the participants data.

## Room participants object

- `joined`: A list that contains all the participants who have joined the meeting.
- `active`: A list that contains all the participants for the current page in the meeting. Its a subset of `joined` array.
- `screenShares`: A list that contains all the participants who have shared screen in the meeting.
- `waitlisted`: A list that contains all the participants waiting to join the meeting.
- `broadcastMessage`: Broadcasts the message to all participants including `self`.
- `pinned`: A nullable participant object represeting the participant who is pinned else it is set to null.
- `activeSpeaker`: A nullable participant object represting latest active speaker in the meeting. 
- `maxNumberOnScreen`: A int showing the maximum number of people set for this meeting.
- `currentPageNumber`: A int showing the current page in this meeting. Participants from this page are filled in the `active` list.
- `pageCount`: A int showing total number of pages available in the meeting.
- `canGoNextPage`: A boolean indicating if next page of joined  participants is available to show.
- `canGoPreviousPage`: A boolean indicating if previous page of joined  participants is available to show.

Each participant in the `joined`, `waitlisted`, `active` and
`screenShares` is type list containing objects of `DyteMeetingParticipant`.

```kotlin
// all joined participants in the meeting
val joined = meeting.participants.joined

// all active participants in the meeting.
// this should be used to show participants on the screen
val active = meeting.participants.active

// participants who are in the waiting room
val waitlisted = meeting.participants.waitlisted

// participants who have shared screen
val screenShares = meeting.participants.screenShares

// latest active speaker in the meeting
val activeSpeaker = meeting.participants.activeSpeaker
```

Similarely you can access the pagination related information like follows: 

```kotlin
val maxNumberOnScreen = meeting.participants.maxNumberOnScreen
val currentPageNumber = meeting.participants.currentPageNumber
val pageCount = meeting.participants.pageCount
val canGoNextPage = meeting.participants.canGoNextPage
val canGoPreviousPage = meeting.participants.canGoPreviousPage
```

## Move between pages in paginated mode

The `setPage(pageNumber: Int)` method allows you to switch between pages of participants present in the meeting.

```kotlin
// switch to 1st page
meeting.participants.setPage(1)
```

## Host control methods

The `meeting.participants` object has host control methods that allow you to disable the audio and video streams of other users in the meeting (given that the user preset has the right permissions).

```kotlin
// mute all participants
meeting.participants.disableAllAudio();

// mute a single participant
val participantToUpdate = meeting.participants.joined.first()
participantToUpdate.disableAudio()

// disable video for all participants
meeting.participants.disableAllVideo();

// disable video for a single participant
val participantToUpdate = meeting.participants.joined.first()
participantToUpdate.disableVideo()
```

Operations related to waiting room
```kotlin
// to accept all waiting room requests for participants in `waitlisted` list
meeting.participants.acceptAllWaitingRequests()
```

To remove all participants from a meeting, you can call the `kickAll()` method.

```kotlin
// remove all participants from the meeting
meeting.participants.kickAll();

// remove a single participant
val participantToRemove = meeting.participants.joined.first()
participantToRemove.kick()
```

## Broadcast message to all participants

```kotlin
// broadcast message
meeting.participants.broadcastMessage(type, payload)
```
