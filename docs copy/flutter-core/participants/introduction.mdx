# Introduction - Participants

The data regarding all meeting participants is stored under `participants`
objects of `DyteMobileClient()` instance. To get all the objects and methods
related to participants:

```dart
  final participants = dyteClient.participants;
```

Use the methods and events to consume the participants data. For example, to get
all the participants who joined the meeting:

```dart
// get all joined participants
final joinedParticipants = dyteClient.participants.joined;
```

The `dyteClient.participants` object has the following properties.

- `waitlisted`: A list that contains all the participants waiting to join the
  meeting. All elements of this array are of type _DyteWaitlistedParticipant_.
- `joined`: A list that contains all the participants who have joined the
  meeting. All elements of this array are of type _DyteJoinedMeetingParticipant_.
- `active`: A list that contains all the participants except the local user who
  are supposed to be on the screen at the moment. All elements of this array are of type _DyteJoinedMeetingParticipant_.
- `screenshares`: A list that contains all the participants who have shared
  screen in the meeting. All elements of this array are of type _DyteJoinedMeetingParticipant_.
- `pinned`: Pinned participant of the meeting. It can be nullable as well. This is of type _DyteJoinedMeetingParticipant_.

Therefore, if you were to make a grid of participants, you'd use the `active`
list, but to display all participants in the meeting you'd use the `joined`
list.

- `dyteClient.pinned` is of type `DyteJoinedMeetingParticipant`.
- All participant in each of the `joined`, `waitlisted`, `active`, and
  `screenshares` list is of type `DyteJoinedMeetingParticipant`.

## Grid info for the room

`DyteGridPagesInfo` object is designed to help you with pagination decisions. It
is returned with `onGridUpdated` event. It contains the following properties:

- `currentPageNumber`: Int, returns the current page number (currently displayed
  by the client).
- `pageCount`: Int, max pages possible with current number of participants.
- `isNextPagePossible`: bool, if the next page of participants is available.
- `isPreviousPagePossible`: bool, if previous page of participants is available.

## Video view

To access the video view of a participant, create an object of the `VideoView` class.

```dart
// To show the video of a participant
final videoView = VideoView(meetingParticipant: participant);
// To get video view for a local user
final selfVideoView = VideoView(isSelfTrue: true);
```

## Move between pages in paginated mode

The `setPage(int pageNumber)` method allows you to switch between pages of
participants present in the meeting.

_Note: Indexing of page starts from 0_

```dart
// switch to page 1
dyteClient.setPage(1);
```

## Broadcast Message to all participants

```dart
// payload is a Map<String, dynamic>
const payload = {
  "message": "Hello World",
};
dyteClient.broadcastMessage("type", payload);
```

## Video update for all participants

Triggered when any participant of the meeting enable/disable it's video. It also passes the participant details who has updated it's video status.

```dart
class ParticipantNotifier implements DyteParticipantEventsListener{

  ...
  @override
  void onVideoUpdate(
    bool videoEnabled,
    DyteJoinedMeetingParticipant participant,
  ) {
    //
  }
  ...
}


```

## Audio update

Triggered when any participant of the meeting enable/disable it's audio. It also passes the participant details who has updated it's audio status.

```dart

class ParticipantNotifier implements DyteParticipantEventsListener{

  ...
  @override
  void onAudioUpdate(
    bool audioEnabled,
    DyteJoinedMeetingParticipant participant,
  ) {
    //
  }
  ...
}

```
