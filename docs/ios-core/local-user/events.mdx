# Local User - Events

You can subscribe to various events on the local user by implementing
`DyteSelfEventsListener` and passing the object to
`meeting.addSelfEventsListener(dyteSelfEventsListener)`.

### Room joined

Triggered when the room join event completes and now the meeting is ready to
produce and consume media.

```swift
extension MeetingViewModel: DyteSelfEventsListener {
    func onRoomJoined() {
        //Room Joined
    }
}
```

### Video update

Triggered when the user starts / stops the video using `enableVideo` or
`disableVideo`

```kotlin
extension MeetingViewModel: DyteSelfEventsListener {
    func onVideoUpdate(videoEnabled: Bool) {
      if (videoEnabled) {
        // video is enabled, and other participants in room can see local user
      } else {
        // video is disabled, and other participants in room can not see local user.
      }
    }
}
```

### Audio update

Triggered when the user starts / stops the audio using `enableAudio` or
`disableAudio`

```swift

extension MeetingViewModel: DyteSelfEventsListener {
    func onAudioUpdate(audioEnabled: Bool) {
      if (audioEnabled) {
        // audio is enabled, and other participants in room can hear local user
      } else {
        // audio is disabled, and other participants in room can not hear local user.
      }
    }
}
```

### Room disconnected update

Triggered when the user is disconnected due to media/network errors

```kotlin
extension MeetingViewModel: DyteSelfEventsListener {
    func onMeetingRoomDisconnected() {
      //disconnected
    }
}
```

### Proximity changed

Triggered when there is any change in proximity. Meaning if device is near ear
piece which triggers display on/off.

```swift
extension MeetingViewModel: DyteSelfEventsListener {
    func onProximityChanged(isNear: Bool) {
      // isNear
      // if true, display should be turned off, as user might be speaking through earpiece
      // if false, display should be turned on, as user might be looking at display and listening through speaker/earphones.
    }
}
```

### Waitlist status

For meetings whose waiting room is enabled:

To get status of localUser in waiting room we can use

```swift
let waitListStatus = meeting.localUser.waitListStatus
```

Developers can listen to those changes in `onWaitListStatusUpdate()` callbacks

```swift
extension MeetingViewModel: DyteSelfEventsListener {
    func onWaitListStatusUpdate(waitListStatus: WaitListStatus) {

    }
}
```

## Webinar Request

The `onWebinarPresentRequestReceived()` callback is triggered when the local user receives a request to join the webinar, while the `onStoppedPresenting()` callback is triggered when the local user ends their presentation.

```swift
extension MeetingViewModel: DyteSelfEventsListener {
    func onWebinarPresentRequestReceived() {
        // Display an alert to the user here, allowing them to accept or reject the request.
    }
    func onStoppedPresenting() {
        //Display an alert to the user indicating that they are no longer presenting.
    }
}
```

## LocalUser removed

Whenever local user is removed from the meeting, `onRemovedFromMeeting()` callback is triggered.

```swift
extension MeetingViewModel: DyteSelfEventsListener {
    func onRemovedFromMeeting() {
      // Display an alert here that user no longer in the meeting.
    }
}
```
