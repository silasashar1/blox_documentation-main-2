### Waitlist Events Listener

To listen for waitlisting events, implement `DyteWaitlistEventsListener` on the `meeting` object.

```swift
meeting.addWaitlistEventListener(waitlistEventListener: self)
```

When registered, callbacks can be observed as follows:

```swift

extension MeetingViewModel: DyteWaitlistEventsListener {

    func onWaitListParticipantJoined(participant: DyteMeetingParticipant) {
        // triggered when waitList peer is joined
    }

    func onWaitListParticipantAccepted(participant: DyteMeetingParticipant) {
        // triggered when waitListed peer is accepted by host
    }

    func onWaitListParticipantRejected(participant: DyteMeetingParticipant) {
        // triggered when entry of waitListed peer declined by host
    }

    func onWaitListParticipantClosed(participant: DyteMeetingParticipant) {
        // triggered when waitListed peer get's disconnected
    }
}
```
