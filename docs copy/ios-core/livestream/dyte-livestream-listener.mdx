You can listen to livestream events by attaching a listener by calling `addLivestreamEventsListener` on `dyteMobileClient` object where `dyteMobileClient` is an instance of `DyteMobileClient()`.

```swift
extension LivestreamViewController: DyteLiveStreamEventsListener {
    public func onJoinRequestAccepted(peer: LiveStreamStagePeer) {
        // when localUser's join request is accepted by host
    }

    public func onJoinRequestRejected(peer: LiveStreamStagePeer) {
        // when localUser's join request is rejected by host
    }

    public func onLiveStreamEnded() {
        // when livestream is ended
    }

    public func onLiveStreamEnding() {
        // when livestream is ending
    }

    public func onLiveStreamErrored() {
        // errored livestream
    }

    public func onLiveStreamStarted() {
        // when livestream is started
    }

    public func onLiveStreamStarting() {
        // when livestream is starting
    }

    public func onLiveStreamStateUpdate(data: DyteLivestreamData) {
        // when there is an update in state of the livestream
    }

    public func onStageCountUpdated(count: Int32) {
        // when stage count updates in livestream
    }

    public func onStageRequestsUpdated(requests: [LiveStreamStageRequestPeer]) {
        // when there are updates in stage requests
    }

    public func onViewerCountUpdated(count: Int32) {
        // when viewer count updates in livestream
    }

}

meeting.addLiveStreamEventsListener(liveStreamEventsListener: self)
```
