The plugin provides certain methods to emit custom events to other peers in the
meeting. You can emit these events to all peers or selected peers.

### Emit a custom event to other peers

| Param     | Type     | Description                                      | Default Value | Required |
| --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------- | -------- |
| eventName | string   | Name of the event.                               | -             | true     |
| data      | any      | Event payload.                                   | -             | false    |
| peerIds   | string[] | IDs of peers to whom you wish to emit the event. | -             | false    |

Note a few event names are reserved and cannot be used:

- `enabled` - Emitted when a plugin is enabled.
- `closed` - Emitted when a plugin is closed.
- `dyteStateUpdate` - Emitted when the state of the plugin has changed.
- `ready` - Emitted when the plugin is ready to exchange data with client SDK.
- `toggleViewMode` - Emitted when the control is toggled for users with
  view-only permissions for a plugin.

```tsx
plugin.emit('myAwesomeEvent', { key: 'value' });
```

```tsx
const peerIds = ['...'];
plugin.emit('myAwesomeEvent', { key: 'value' }, peerIds);
```

### Listen for custom events from other peers

```jsx
plugin.on('myAwesomeEvent', (data) => {
  console.log('do something');
});
```

_Alias:_

```jsx
plugin.addListener('myAwesomeEvent', (data) => {
  console.log('do something');
});
```

### Remove event listeners

```jsx
plugin.removeListeners('myAwesomeEvent');
```
