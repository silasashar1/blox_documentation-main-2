# Introduction

Dyte's React Native UI Kit is a prebuilt design library of UI components that makes it
easy to integrate video and voice calls into any app or website within minutes.

## Usage

The UI Kit under the hood works on top of the same Core SDK that is publicly available. Core SDK handles all the low-level media and network handling parts
of a meeting and exposes methods and properties that the UI Kit uses

Uses a layered design structure, allowing you to start with one prebuilt component and slowly go down layers and add custom UI incrementally as your needs evolve.

- **Use prebuilt component**: You can use prebuilt component `<DyteMeeting />` to
  create your meeting quickly. With this component, you don't have to handle all
  the states, dialogs, and other aspects of managing the application. The UI kit
  also respect your permissions and theming configuration from the preset.

  For more information, see [UI Kit Quickstart](/react-native/quickstart).

- **Mix and match**: Use some components from our component library, build some custom components yourself. Read the [basics of our component design](/react-native/basics/components-basics) and checkout the [gallery of available components](/react-native/components)

## Supported Devices

Here are the device requirements:

- Android API Level 24 and above
- iOS 12 and above

## Features

- Dyte UI Kit is built using
  [React Native components](https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis). React Native Components are a built-in components that enables you to develop reusable custom elements without relying on any third-party frameworks.
- Dyte's React Native UI Kit also provides multiple
  [Hooks](https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react). Hooks let you use different
  React features from your components. This provides seamless developer
  experience when integrating Dyte's UI Kit in your React project. You can
  simply import the package from `@dytesdk/react-native-core`, which is a hooks
  wrapper on `@dytesdk/react-native-core`. For more information, see
  [Use React Native Core Hooks](/react-native/using-hooks).
- Each component uses design tokens in conjunction with CSS variables for
  styling. This makes the customization super simple and easy. Other than the
  design tokens, we've also attempted to improve the customization options, with
  features like Internationalisation (i18n) and Icon Packs Support.
