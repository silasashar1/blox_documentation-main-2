It all starts with creating a meeting which is needed to start a live video call. After a meeting has been created on Dyte's server, you can now add participants to the meeting. Each participant is given an `authToken` which is necessary for your client side to further interact with the meeting.

Let's dive into further details.

### Step 1: Create a meeting

There are two ways to go about creating a meeting.

1. Create a Dyte meeting using the [Create Meeting API](/api#/operations/create_meeting). The API returns a unique identifier for your meeting which you will be using later.

2. If you are going for a no-code integration, you can also create a meeting using the [Developer Portal](https://accounts.dyte.io/) and copy the unique identifier for the meeting.

Dyte meetings do not have a specific date or time associated to them, so you can either create
them in advance or right when users need to join the meeting.

### Step 2: Create Presets

A preset is a set of permissions and UI configurations that are applied to participants for different meeting types such as Group Call, Webinar, and Livestream. The presets define how a meeting will appear visually and functional aspects of the meeting. They allow customization options like setting maximum number of participants on-screen, permissions to share screen, enabling poll creation, disabling video and audio, adjusting text color, configuring plugins, etc.

To create or update a preset, please refer to our Developer Portal's [Presets Section](https://dev.dyte.io/presets).

:::tip Note
A preset can be reused for multiple participants, even across multiple meetings. You don't have to create new presets for each and every meeting/participant.

It is advised to keep preset count minimal.

### Step 3: Add Participants

Now that you have a meeting, it's time to add participants to the meeting. There are two ways in which you can add participants to a meeting:

1. Call the [Add Participant API](/api#/operations/add_participant) with the unique identifier of your meeting. To specify the preset that your participant should use, remember to pass the `preset_name` parameter as well.

2. Similar to creating a meeting, you can also add participants to the meeting through the [Developer Portal](https://accounts.dyte.io/) and share the `authToken` with the respective participants.

On successfully creating a participant, you will receive an authorization token (`authToken`) for each participant. Your server has complete control over when to distribute this token to the participants. Your client side needs the `authToken` to connect and interact with the meeting.

## What's Next?

You have completed the basic steps needed to integrate dyte on the server side. Now, you can move now to integrating dyte on your client side or you can learn more about the different [REST APIs](/api/) that Dyte provides and how you can utilise them.
