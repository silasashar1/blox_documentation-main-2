# Recording

The `meeting.recording` object can be used start and stop recordings in a
meeting. You can also get the current status of a recording using this API.

The `meeting.recording` object has the following properties:

- `recordingState`: Indicates the current recording state of the meeting.

## Start a recording

To start a recording, you can call the `start` method in the `meeting.recording`
object. The valid states are `IDLE`, `STARTING`, `RECORDING`, and `STOPPING`.

```swift
meeting.recording.start()
```

## Stop a recording

Call `meeting.recording.stop()` to stop the active recording.

```swift
meeting.recording.stop()
```

## Pause a recording

Call `meeting.recording.pause()` to pause the active recording.

```swift
meeting.recording.pause();
```

## Resume a paused recording

Call `meeting.recording.resume()` to resume the paused recording.

```swift
meeting.recording.resume();
```

## Get active recording state

The `meeting.recording.recordingState` property describes the current state of
the recording. The valid states are `IDLE`, `STARTING`, `RECORDING`, and
`STOPPING`.

## Listening to recording events in a meeting

To receive recording events, you must implement methods from `DyteRecordingEventsListener`.
You can subscribe to these events by using the `meeting.addRecordingEventsListener(dyteRecordingEventsListener: listener)` method.

```swift
extension MeetingViewModel: DyteRecordingEventsListener {

  func onMeetingRecordingEnded() {
    // your code to handle recording end
  }

  func onMeetingRecordingStarted() {
    // your code to handle recording start
  }

  func onMeetingRecordingStateUpdated(state: DyteRecordingState) {
    // your code to handle recording state update
  }

  func onMeetingRecordingStopError(e: KotlinException) {
    // your code to handle recording stop error
  }
}
```
