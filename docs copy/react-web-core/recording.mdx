# Recording

The `meeting.recording` object can be used start and stop recordings in a
meeting. You can also get the current status of a recording using this API.

The `meeting.recording` object has the following properties:

- `recordingState`: Indicates the current recording state of the meeting.

## Start a recording

To start a recording, you can call the `start` method in the `meeting.recording`
object. The valid states are `IDLE`, `STARTING`, `RECORDING`, and `STOPPING`.

```ts
await meeting.recording.start();
```

## Stop a recording

Call `meeting.recording.stop()` to stop the active recording.

```ts
await meeting.recording.stop();
```

## Recording Configuration

You can set the defaults for recording during initialization

```js
const meeting = await DyteClient.init({
  authToken,
  defaults: {
    recording: recordingConfig,
  },
});
```

In recording config you can specify height, width and codec of the recording output

```ts
interface RecordingConfig {
  videoConfig?: {
    height?: number;
    width?: number;
    codec?: 'H264' | 'VP8';
  };
}
```

1. **codec** - Codec using which the recording will be encoded. `H264` will use a `mp4` container, `VP8` will use a `webm` container

   Allowed values: `H264` | `VP8`

   Default: `H264`

2. **width** - Width of the recording video in pixels
   Allowed values: 1 \>= width \<= 1920

   Default: `1280`

3. **height** - Height of the recording video in pixels
   Allowed values: 1 \>= height \<= 1920

   Default: `720`

## Check active recording state

The `meeting.recording.recordingState` property describes the current state of
the recording. The valid states are `IDLE`, `STARTING`, `RECORDING`, and
`STOPPING`.
