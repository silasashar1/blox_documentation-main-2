# Quickstart

:::info Before Getting Started

Before you start integrating Dyte into your application, make sure you've read
the [Getting Started with Dyte](/getting-started) topic and completed the steps
in the [Integrate Dyte](/getting-started#integrate-dyte) section.

:::

The DyteClient is the root class of the SDK. It is the main entry point of the
SDK. It is the only class that you need to instantiate in order to use the SDK.

To instantiate DyteClient, you can run the following command:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { useDyteClient, DyteProvider } from '@dytesdk/react-native-core';

export default function App() {
  const [meeting, initMeeting] = useDyteClient();
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const init = async () => {
      const meetingOptions = {
        audio: true,
        video: true,
      };
      await initMeeting({
        authToken: 'YourAuthToken',
        defaults: meetingOptions,
      });
    };
    init();
    if (meeting) meeting.joinRoom();
  }, []);

  if (meeting)
    return (
      <DyteProvider value={meeting}>
        {/* Render you Components here*/}
        {/* Components rendered inside DyteProvider can access DyteClient object using useDyteClient() hook */}
      </DyteProvider>
    );
}
```

You can get the authToken using our backend APIs and then pass it
to the init method of DyteClient.

:::info

Once join room process completes `roomJoined` event is emitted on `meeting.self`
namespace. If you want to take any actions like enabling audio, video or start
and stop recording etc. it should be done after the `roomJoined` event is fired.

For example:

```ts
meeting.self.on('roomJoined', () => {
  console.log('User has joined the room', meeting.self.roomJoined);
  // run my actions.
});

await meeting.joinRoom();
```

:::

### Leave room

Leave the meeting room.

```js
await meeting.leaveRoom();
```
