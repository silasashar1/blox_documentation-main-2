Plugin SDK allows you to exchange data between the dyte meeting and the plugin.
This guide talks about how this can be done:

## Client SDK

### Send custom messages to plugin SDK

The `ready` event is emitted once the plugin is ready to accept data from the
client SDK. all custom events must be sent only after this event is emitted.

The `sendData` method accepts an object with the following properties:

| Property  | Description                              | Type   |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------ |
| eventName | Name of the event.                       | string |
| data      | The data you wish to send to the plugin. | any    |

```ts
const id = '<your-plugin-id>';
const plugin = meeting.plugins.all.get(id);

plugin.on('ready', () => {
  plugin.sendData({
    eventName: 'customEventToPlugin',
    data: '<your-custom-data>',
  });
});
```

### Listen for custom events from plugin SDK

```ts
const id = '<your-plugin-id>';
const plugin = meeting.plugins.all.get(id);

plugin.on('myAwesomeEvent', (data) => {
  console.log(data);
});
```

## Plugin SDK

### Send custom events to the dyte meeting

The emitEvent method is used to emit custom events to the (client SDK) room.

```ts
import DytePlugin from "@dytesdk/plugin-sdk";

const plugin = DytePlugin.init();

plugin.room.emitEvent('myAwesomeEvent', {...});
```

### Listen for custom messages from the dyte meeting

```ts
import DytePlugin from '@dytesdk/plugin-sdk';

const plugin = DytePlugin.init();

plugin.room.on('customEventToPlugin', (data) => {
  console.log(data);
});
```
