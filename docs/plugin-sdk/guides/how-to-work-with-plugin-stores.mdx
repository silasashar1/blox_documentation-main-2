The plugin SDK offers a realtime key-value database. This can be accessed under
the `plugin.stores` modules

There are a bunch of things you can do with plugin stores. Like
creating/deleting stores and basic CRUD operation on every store.

### Creating stores

Stores can be global or local. Local stores are available only to the user that
created them while global stores are available to everyone.

:::danger important

Store creation is a local event. It is recommended that it occurs for all
clients.

:::

Here's how you can create a store:

```ts
    // create a global store
    const videoStore = plugin.stores.create('youtube');

    // create a local store
    const my-playlist = plugin.stores.create('private-playlist', { local: true });
```

### Subscribing to stores changes

Once a store is created the next step would be to subscribe to changes. It is
recommended that you do this just after the store is created.

You can subscribe to a particular key in the store like so. Please note that you
do not need to define a key before subscribing to it.

```ts
    const videoStore = plugin.stores.create('youtube');
    videoStore.subscribe('video', (data) => {
        ...
    });
```

### Updating the store

Updating a key in the store is an asynchronous task. When a user updates the
store, it will be updated for all users.

All users subscribed to the store will receive a notification for it.

```ts
const button = document.getElementById('play-video');
button.addEventListener('click', async () => {
  await videoStore.set('video', {
    url: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGl4XZ_zr5w',
  });
  const vid = videoStore.get('video');
});
```
