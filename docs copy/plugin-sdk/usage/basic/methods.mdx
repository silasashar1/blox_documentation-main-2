### Initialize

This method initializes the SDK and returns a plugin object. The Client SDK
(web/mobile) receives a `ready` event once the initialisation is complete.

the `ready` event signifies that the plugin is now ready for event/data
exchange.

```tsx
const plugin = await DytePlugin.init();
```

### Initialize without data exchange

This method initializes the SDK without emitting a `ready` event to the client
SDK. The user can choose to manually emit this later when the plugin is ready to
start event/data exchange with client SDK.

```tsx
const plugin = await DytePlugin.init({ ready: false });
// do something ...
plugin.ready();
```
