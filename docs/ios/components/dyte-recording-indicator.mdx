# DyteRecordingView

A component which indicates the recording status of a meeting.

It will not render anything if no recording is taking place.

```swift
private lazy var recordingView: DyteRecordingView = {
       let view = DyteRecordingView(
                      meeting: self.meeting,
                      title: "Rec",
                      image: nil,
                      appearance: AppTheme.shared.recordingViewAppearance)
        view.isHidden = true
        return view
    }()
```
