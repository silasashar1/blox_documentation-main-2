# Room Metadata

All metadata related to a meeting is stored in `meeting.meta`. This includes:

- `roomName`: The name of the room the current participant is connected to.
- `roomType`: Indicates the meeting is a group-call, webinar or livestream.
- `meetingTitle`: The title of the meeting.
- `meetingStartedTimestamp`: The timestamp when the meeting started.

For example, if you want to get the name of the room the current participant is
connected to, you can do so by doing:

```dart
final roomName = meeting.meta.roomName;
print("The local user has joined room ${roomName}.");
```
