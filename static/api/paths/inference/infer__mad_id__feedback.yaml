  summary: Feedback
  description: Our systems are fairly robust and do provide a certain high degree of accuracy, as with every ML system, the models that are built also improve over time with feedback. While our teams regularly iterate on the models and keep training them with new data, and indeed keep improving on the available tags, customer feedback is also a key component of the engagement. Hence, we provide customers with this API to provide periodic feedback based on their QA process.
