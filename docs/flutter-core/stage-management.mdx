## Access the stage APIs

Stage feature is useful when you're using webinar/livestream. We allow central stage methods for both call types.

Using Dyte's stage management APIs a user can do actions such as request to join, join/leave stage, grant/deny stage access to other users, etc.

All stage APIs are accessible by following excerpt:

```dart
final stage = dyteClient.stage;
```

## Properties

### Status

The following method returns the current stage status of the local user.

```dart
final DyteStageStatus stageStatus = dyteClient.stage.status;
```

It can have the following values:

- DyteStageStatus.onStage : This value indicates that the user is currently on the stage.
- DyteStageStatus.offStage : This value means that the user is viewing the webinar/livestream but is not on the stage.
- DyteStageStatus.requestedToJoinStage : The user has a pending request to join stage. This value will be assigned to their status until the host accepts or rejects their request.
- DyteStageStatus.acceptedToJoinStage : The host has accepted user's request to join stage. If the host accepts the user's request to join the stage, this value will be assigned to the user's status.

## Host Controls

:::tip Note

These methods are preset dependent, hence if a user's preset doesn't allow certain host actions, calling the API won't change anything.

:::

Dyte's stage management APIs allow hosts to receive and manage stage requests as well as leave and join the stage.

### Join stage

This method enables the user to be on stage and let them interact with other peers in the meeting.

```dart
dyteClient.stage.join();
```

### Leave stage

This method lets user leave the stage and. Additionally, their audio/video will no longet be visible to others in the room.

```dart
dyteClient.stage.leave();
```

### Grant stage access

A privileged user can grant access to stage for a set of users with `grantAccess` method.

| **Parameters** | **Type**                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| peer           | _DyteJoinedMeetingParticipant_ |

```dart
dyteClient.stage.grantAccess(peer);
```

To grant access to all stage requests at a time, you can user `grantAccessToAll()` method. This method takes no parameters.

```dart
dyteClient.stage.grantAccessToAll();
```

### Deny stage access

A privileged user can deny access to stage for a set of users with `denyAccess` method.

| **Parameters** | **Type**                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| peer           | _DyteJoinedMeetingParticipant_ |

```dart
dyteClient.stage.denyAccess(peer);
```

To deny all stage requests at a time, you can user `denyAccessToAll()` method. This method takes no parameters.

```dart
dyteClient.stage.denyAccessToAll();
```

### Kick participant from stage

A privileged user can kick a participant from stage with `kick` method.

| **Parameters** | **Type**                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| peer           | _DyteJoinedMeetingParticipant_ |

```dart
dyteClient.stage.kick(peer);
```

## Participant controls

Dyte's stage management APIs allow participant to receive and manage stage requests as well as leave and join the stage.

### Request access

This method is used to create a new stage request which can be approved by the host.

```dart
dyteClient.stage.requestAccess();
```

### Withdraw join request

You can call this method in order to cancel your stage request.

```dart
dyteClient.stage.withdrawJoinRequest();
```

## Stage Events

To be able to listen to stage events, you need to attach a stage events listener as:

```dart
class StageEventListener extends DyteStageEventsListener {
  ...

  @override
  void onStageStatusUpdated(DyteStageStatus status) {
    // Update your UI as per this stage status.
  }
  ...
}
```

```dart
dyteClient.addStageEventsListener(StageEventsListener())
```

When the stage status of local user is updated, this event is triggered. It contains updated stage status as an argument.

```dart
@override
void onStageStatusUpdated(DyteStageStatus status){
  // Update your UI/ manage you state as per this stage status.
}
```

Here are a list of events the stage occurs:

| **Event**                       | **Description**                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `onStageRequestsUpdated`        | Emitted when stageRequests changes. This event also contain a list of updated requests in the payload as `accessRequests`     |
| `onStageStatusUpdated`          | Emitted when the user's stage status changes. It contains the updated stage status in the payload as `stageStatus`.           |
| `onParticipantRemovedFromStage` | Emitted when a participant is removed from stage. It contains the participant that is removed in the payload as `participant` |
