# DyteLeaveMeetingDialog

A dialog widget designed for confirming the action of leaving a Dyte meeting. This widget is part of the Dyte UI Kit and is intended to provide a clear and concise user interface for confirming the exit process from a meeting environment.

## Usage

Here is how you can use the `DyteLeaveMeetingDialog` in your Flutter application:

```dart
DyteLeaveMeetingDialog(
  dyteMobileClient: yourDyteMobileClientInstance,
)
```

## Properties

- `designToken`: (Optional) An instance of `DyteDesignTokens` for customizing the appearance according to the Dyte Design System. If not specified, the widget will default to the global design tokens.

## Design Token

The `DyteLeaveMeetingDialog` utilizes `DyteDesignTokens` for theming:

- `borderRadius`: The border radius of the dialog box, which defaults to a value defined in the design tokens.
- `fillColor`: The background color of the dialog, typically set to provide a neutral or alerting backdrop for the content.
- `textColor`: The color of the text within the dialog, ensuring it is readable against the `fillColor`.
