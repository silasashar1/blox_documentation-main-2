# Advanced usage

## Audio/Video config options while joining meeting.

```kotlin {3,4,8,11}
val meetingInfo = DyteMeetingInfoV2(
  authToken = state.authToken,
  enableAudio = true,
  enableVideo = true
)
val config = DyteUIKitConfig(
  activity = this,
  dyteMeetingInfo = meetingInfo,
)
val dyteUIKit = DyteUIKitBuilder.build(config)
```

## Control the meeting, and take meeting & participant actions

The `Meeting` instance (referenced as `meeting` below) helps you interact with
the meeting. You can get access to meeting object as follows.

```kotlin
val meeting = dyteUIKit.meeting
```

:::tip Note
Once you have access to `meeting` object you can listen to all events triggered in core-sdk.
Please read [core docs](/android-core/)
:::

You can get the UI configuration of the meeting in progress using the
`designTokens` property of `Meeting`.

```kotlin
val designTokens = dyteUIKit.designTokens
```

You can take actions on the meeting as well as the participants. You can also
setup custom controls to that interact with the meeting in certain ways that
help you send events and messages across to other participants in the meeting.

## Get info about the meeting's UI configuration

```kotlin
val colors = designTokens.colors
val textColors = designTokens.colors.text
val brandColors = designTokens.colors.brand
val backgroundColors = designTokens.colors.background
val videoBackgroundColor = designTokens.colors.videoBackground
val statusColors = designTokens.colors.status
```

## Get info about the plugins configured for the meeting

You can get info about the plugins configured for the meeting in progress using
the `plugins` property of `Meeting`.

```kotlin
val activePlugins = meeting.plugins.active
val allPlugins = meeting.plugins.all
```

## Self controls inside meeting

### Mic control

To turn off the mic

```kotlin
meeting.localUser.disableAudio()
```

To turn on the mic

```kotlin
meeting.localUser.enableAudio()
```

## Camera control

To turn off the camera

```kotlin
meeting.localUser.disableVideo()
```

To turn on the camera

```kotlin
meeting.localUser.enableVideo()
```

### Leave meeting

To leave the meeting

```kotlin
meeting.leaveRoom()
```

## Get list of all participants in the meeting

You can get a list of all participants in the meeting using the `participants`
property of `meeting`.

```kotlin
val participants = meeting.participants
val active = participants.active
val joined = participants.joined
```

For active speaker and pinned participant in the meeting use as follows

```kotlin
val screenshares = participants.screenshares
val activeSpeker = participants.activeSpeaker
val pinned = participants.pinned
```

## Controlling individual participants and actions

Dyte client SDK provide methods and properties to help you control participant
actions and certain UI elements. This could include actions that affect the
participant themselves as well as other participants (like a host with
privileged permissions may want to control the video of other participants).
This section defines all the possible properties and actions that can be taken.

To get hold of participant you want to manage, do as follows

```kotlin
val participant = meeting.participants.joined.find { it.id = "my_participant_id" }
```

#### Disable participant's audio stream

To remotely turn the participant's mic off, you can do

```kotlin
participant.disableAudio()
```

#### Check if participant's video is on

To check whether a participant's video is on (camera is turned on), you can use

```kotlin
val video = participant.videoEnabled;
```

which sets the value of `video` to a boolean specifying if the camera is on or
not.

#### Get participant video stream

If the participant's video is on, you can get the associated video stream using

```kotlin
val videoStream = participant.getVideoView()
```

#### Disable participant's audio stream

To remotely turn the participant's camera off, you can do

```kotlin
participant.disableVideo()
```

#### Check if the participant is pinned to the grid

To check whether a participant's video is pinned to the meeting grid; by the
host, by the user, by the preset, or by any other mechanism; you can use

```kotlin
val pinned = participant.isPinned;
```

which sets the value of `pinned` to a boolean specifying whether the video is
pinned or not.

#### Pin a participant video to the grid

You can pin a participant's video to the grid using

```kotlin
participant.pin();
```

#### Unpin a participant video from the grid

You can unpin a participant's video from the grid using

```kotlin
participant.unpin();
```
