**Audience Builder** lets you segment your visitors into different audiences by defining custom audiences based on your business goals. An audience consists of a group of visitors who share similar characteristics. You can measure the health of the business, publish recommendations, and conduct experiments using Audiences.

## Audience Details

- **Description:** Give a brief description of the audience.
- **Duration Settings:**
  - **Refresh Frequency:** Refers to how often the audience data should be computed and updated. The various options available for Refresh Frequency are ‘Once every 4 hours’,  ‘Once every 6 hours’,  ‘Once every 8 hours’,  ‘Once every 12 hours’,  ‘Once a day’.
  - **Lookback Period:** Refers to the time period up to which the system should lookback for visitor data. The various options available for Lookback Period are ‘Last 1 day’, ‘Last 7 days’, ‘Last 30 days’, ‘Last 60 days’, ‘Last 90 days’, ‘Last 180 days’.

Define the audience criteria to form the audience in condition/sequence groups. If you want to capture events happening sequentially made by users, to define events sequentially, the criteria should be defined in a sequence group.

Audience Criteria consists of Parameters. A parameter is a dimension or a field that describes a visitor/user such as demographics, interests, affinity, etc. An audience can be defined using any one of the available parameters. Examples of parameters: Gender, Number of Visits.

A condition group consists of one or more rules. Each rule will have features defined in the same level. By default, there will be one condition group. The user can add any number of condition groups. Example: Brand ‘Equals’ Nike, Country Equals ‘India’ can be defined in a condition group.

A sequence group consists of one or more rules (Events) defined with time intervals between each event. Each rule will be executed sequentially. Each rule will have an event and one or more attributes associated with it. You can add any number of sequence groups. Example: Users who added Puma shoes to cart and bought them within 2 days can be defined in a sequence group.

Once you define the criteria, click on ‘Create’ CTA to create the audience.
Expect a creation time of approximately 20-30 minutes for the audience, after which you will be able to access its metrics. An audience once created will be made available to use in Experience creation.

Note: You can save your audience config anytime by clicking on "Continue Later " CTA & clicking on " Save & Exit". The audience is displayed on the listing screen in a draft state. (Partially filled details are not saved).

When using the Audience Builder to define audiences, it is valuable to have Audience Metrics available for analysis. These metrics provide a broad understanding of the audience size and performance compared to the remaining site-wide audience. By comparing the number of visitors in the defined audience with the total visitors across the website, users can assess the reach and impact of their targeted segment.

Let us build some audiences to understand it better.


1) Let’s build a simple audience where the users are Male iPhone users.

Click on ‘Add Group’ and select ‘Condition’
In Rule 1 of Group 1, define the parameter Group as ‘Demographics’, parameter Name as ‘Gender’, Operator as ‘==’, and the value as ‘Male’
Click on the ‘Add Rule’ button to add a new rule.
In Rule 2 of Group 1, define the parameter Group as ‘Electronic device based parameters’, parameter Name as ‘iPhone User’, Operator as ‘==’, and the value as ‘Yes’.
The logical operator between the Rules is ‘AND’. The default option for it is ‘ALL’ on Rule level.
On clicking the ‘Create’ button from the audience definition section, the audience defined will be created and will be available on the listing page.

Note: 
    A rule can be deleted by clicking on the ‘Delete Rule’ button. A condition can be deleted using the delete icon.

Creating an audience with sequence:

1) Let’s build an audience where Users who added shoes to cart on Tatacliq and bought them within 1 day.

In Rule 2 of Group 1, define the parameter Group as ‘Tatacliq’, parameter Name as ‘Events for Tatacliq’, Operator as ‘==’, and the value as ‘Buy’.
In Rule 2 of Group 1, define another parameter Group as ‘Tatacliq’, parameter Name as ‘Products for Tatacliq’, Operator as ‘==’, and the value as ‘Shoes’.
There will be no logical operators between rules in a sequence group.
‘Clear All’ button enables you to clear the conditions defined.
On clicking the ‘Create’ button from the audience definition section, the audience defined will be created and will be available on the listing page.
