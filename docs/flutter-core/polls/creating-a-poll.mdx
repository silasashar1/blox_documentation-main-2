# Creating a poll

A new poll can be created using the `create` method from the
[`dyteClient.polls`](./introduction) object. The `dyteClient.polls.create()`
method accepts the following params.

| Param     | Type     | Default Value | Required | Description                                |
| --------- | -------- | ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| question  | string   | -             | yes      | The question that is to be voted for.      |
| options   | string[] | -             | yes      | The options of the poll.                   |
| anonymous | boolean  | -             | yes      | If true, the poll votes are anonymous.     |
| hideVotes | boolean  | -             | yes      | If true, the votes on the poll are hidden. |

The following snippet creates a poll where votes are anonymous.

```dart
dyteClient.polls.create(
    question: "Are you an early bird or a night owl?",
    options: ["Early bird", "Night owl"],
    anonymous: true,
    hideVotes: false,
);
```

# Voting on a poll

The `dyteClient.polls.vote()` method can be used to register a vote on a poll.
It accepts the following params.

| Param       | Type            | Default Value | Required | Description                                                |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| pollMessage | DytePollMessage | -             | yes      | Contains all the poll properties (question, options, etc.) |
| pollOption  | DytePollOption  | yes           | yes      | Option on which the user voted                             |

The following snippet votes for the 1st option on the 1st poll created in the
meeting.

```dart
final poll = dyteClient.polls.polls[0];
final selectedPollOption = poll.options[0];
dyteClient.polls.vote(poll, selectedPollOption);
```
